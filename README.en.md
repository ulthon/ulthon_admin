## Installation tutorial

>ulthon_admin uses Composer to manage project dependencies. Therefore, before using ulthon_admin, make sure your machine has Composer installed.

> It is recommended to set the composer's image to the Alibaba image source

### Download the installation package through git, and install dependency packages through composer

```bash
The first step is to download the installation package
git clone https://gitee.com/ulthon/ulthon_admin

Or use composer to create
composer create-project ulthon/ulthon_admin


The second step is to install dependent packages (can be ignored when created using composer)
composer install

The third step, configure `.env`
Copy `.example.env` to `.env`
Modify `env` file

[DATABASE]
TYPE=mysql
HOSTNAME=host.docker.internal
DATABASE=ulthon
USERNAME=root
PASSWORD=root
HOSTPORT=3306
CHARSET=utf8
DEBUG=true
PREFIX=ul_


Step 4, install the database
php think migrate:run

Step 5: Initialize database data
php think seed:run

Finally, run locally temporarily
php think run

```

> This installation method is very friendly to the development experience

### ~~Download the complete package~~

The complete package download method is being updated.


### Online installation (initialization) database

The framework does not have the function of online installation, and it will not be provided built-in in the future.

However, ulthon_admin uses the database migration tool to install the database. It does not have to be used in the command line environment. It can also be used in ordinary controllers. We provide a simple code script to demonstrate how to install it online.

## new version update

Keep in sync with the versions of thinkPHP and layui.

In the future, whenever a new feature is implemented, a tag will be released.

> The main meaning of tag is to facilitate querying documents and comparing differences. (ulthon_admin itself is for customization and will not be forced to update)

## Development dependencies

### Basic environment

Only the most basic PHP development environment is required.

- PHP8.0 (PATH environment variable is set correctly)
- composer
- Mysql5.7+ (necessary for development)

In the development environment, it is not necessary to install nginx, apache, ftp and other software, and you can develop directly through the built-in server.

> In fact, if you use SQLite to develop, you don't even want to install MySQL, but SQLite cannot adjust data tables and columns very well, so you generally use conventional databases such as MySQL.

### SASS

Some underlying components in the framework use SASS features, but generally you donâ€™t need to worry about it. If you use vscode, you can refer to the following:

```
Name: Live Sass Compiler
ID: glenn2223.live-sass
Description: Compile Sass or Scss to CSS at realtime.
Version: 5.5.1
Posted by: Glenn Marks
VS Marketplace link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass
```

### Configuration

Configuration of liveSassCompiler in vscode:

```json
{
     "liveSassCompile.settings.includeItems": [
         "/public/static/common/css/theme/*.scss",
         "/public/static/plugs/lay-module/tableData/tableData.scss",
         "/public/static/plugs/lay-module/tagInput/tagInput.scss",
         "/public/static/plugs/lay-module/propertyInput/propertyInput.scss"
     ]
}
```
